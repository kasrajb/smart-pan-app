## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

Based on user research and usability testing:

1. **Learnability** - Users understand the interface within 2 minutes
2. **Efficiency** - Setting temperature takes less than 30 seconds
3. **Clarity** - Clear distinction between current and target temperatures
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Temperature displays are the focal point
5. **Simplicity** - Only essential features, no clutter

### Color Palette
- **Heating/Active**: Orange (#ff6b35) - indicates heating in progress
- **Ready/Success**: Green (#4caf50) - target temperature reached
- **Idle/Neutral**: Gray (#607d8b) - neutral states
- **Warning**: Red (#f44336) - errors and warnings

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No build tools or dependencies required (vanilla JavaScript)

### Installation
1. Download all project files to a folder
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. That's it! No server or installation needed.

### For Local Development
If you want to test with a local server:

```powershell
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## ðŸ“± Usage Guide

### Setting Your Preferred Unit
1. **Toggle between Â°F and Â°C**: Click the unit toggle in the top-right corner
2. **Default is Fahrenheit** (Â°F) - common for North American cooking
3. **All displays update instantly** when you switch units
4. **Your preference is saved** for next time

### Setting a Target Temperature

**In Fahrenheit (Â°F):**
1. Enter temperature between 200Â°F and 500Â°F, OR
2. Use quick presets: Low (300Â°F), Medium (360Â°F), High (450Â°F)
3. Click "Start Heating"

**In Celsius (Â°C):**
1. Enter temperature between 100Â°C and 300Â°C, OR
2. Use quick presets: Low (150Â°C), Medium (180Â°C), High (230Â°C)
3. Click "Start Heating"

### Monitoring Progress
- **Current temperature** displayed in large numbers at center
- **Progress bar** shows percentage to target (e.g., "75%")
- **Status indicator** shows "Heating..." or "âœ“ Target Reached!"
- **Overheating warning** appears if temperature exceeds safe threshold
- **Sound notification** plays when target is reached

### Adjusting During Heating
- **Switch units**: Toggle Â°F/Â°C even while heating
- **Change Target**: Modify target temperature mid-heating
- **Cancel**: Stop heating and return to start screen
- **Cancel**: Stop heating and return to start screen

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

The application has been designed to handle:

âœ… **Unit Conversion**
- Switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius during input
- Switch units while actively heating
- All temperatures convert accurately
- Presets update to match selected unit

âœ… **Temperature Validation**
- Valid input in Fahrenheit (e.g., 360Â°F) and Celsius (e.g., 180Â°C)
- Invalid inputs (empty, non-numeric, out of range)
- Error messages reference correct unit

âœ… **Heating & Monitoring**
- Target reached detection with visual and audio alerts
- Progress bar shows accurate percentage
- Overheating warning triggers at 20Â°F/10Â°C over target
- Cancel and restart operations

âœ… **Preset Buttons**
- Active state feedback when clicked
- Immediate value population
- Updates when switching units

âœ… **Responsive Design**
- Mobile phones (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktop browsers (1024px+)

## ðŸ”Œ Hardware Integration (Future)

The code is structured for easy hardware integration:

### Hardware Components (Next Phase)
- Raspberry Pi Pico W (WiFi microcontroller)
- MAX6675 thermocouple module
- K-type temperature probe
- LED indicator
- Buzzer/speaker

### Integration Points

**In `app.js`**, look for these marked sections:

```javascript
/**
 * HARDWARE INTEGRATION POINT:
 * Replace simulateTemperatureIncrease() with:
 * 
 * function receiveRealTemperature(sensorData) {
 *     appState.currentTemp = sensorData.temperature;
 *     updateTemperatureDisplay();
 *     checkTargetReached();
 * }
 */
```

The web app will run on the Pico W and receive real sensor data via:
- HTTP requests to MicroPython endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- MQTT messaging (depending on implementation)
